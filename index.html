            <h2>Chad Whitaker</h2>
            <h3>A Software Developer,
                <br>among many other things</h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm Chad Whitaker! I'm a student at Momentum Learning in Durham, NC. Some of my interests outside of Software
                Development include: Soccer, Disc Golf, NC State Athletics, and my dog.
            </p>
            <p>I graduated from North Carolina State University in 2015 with a B.S. degree in Business Administration - Finance
                Concentration and a Minor in Economics. While in school, I was the treasurer and president of my fraternity,
                Pi Kappa Alpha.</p>
            <p>My early work experience includes internships for the Corporate Social Responsibility department and Government
                Affairs department. After graduation, I joined Quintiles (now IQVIA) as a Contracts Analyst Intern. I was
                hired as a Contracts Analyst I the following Fall. I spent another year in that position before transferring
                into a Pharmaceutical Sales Representative role. During my time in this role I visited target doctors, physicians
                assistants, and nurse practitioners. I learned a great deal in the year and a half in this position as it
                was my first and only experience in Sales. At the end of May 2018, I decided to quit my job and attend Momentum
                to get the skills I need to be a Software Developer. Keep checking this site as I develop my portfolio!
